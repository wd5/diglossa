<h4>Μορφεύς v.0.2 RC1 </h4>

<p>Morpheus - version 0.2 - the simplest morphological analyzer
based on the Latin-Russian dictionary by I.H.Dvoretsky for determining 
correctness of estimated values.
</p>

<p>In the next upcoming versions will be able to perform a simplest
partial syntactic parsing (aka shallow approach). For example, to
define descriptive times and so on.  </p>

<p>Morpheus includes more than 3000 tests. Tests were generated with
the help of a remarkable application "Words" by William Whitaker: <a
href="http://archives.nd.edu/whitaker/words.htm">
http://archives.nd.edu/whitaker/words.htm</a>. It was also used for adding
   English translations in the dictionary..</p>

<p>release candidate 1, but not simply version 0.2 - because there are
a lot of known problems and bugs.</p>

<p>including among other: lack of processing of numerals, proper
names, many small morphological types, such as, for example, the verbs
perfect in form, but ordinary by value. Et cetera.  And a lot of irregular
problems due to the complexity of processing a text version of the dictionary I.H. Dvoretsky.
</p>

<p>I hope that these problems will be solved step-by-step over the next few years<p>
