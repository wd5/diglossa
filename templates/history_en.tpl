  <h4> history </h4>

  <p> this e-lib was born as a supplementary tool for seminar by
  A.V.Akhutin, named "reading texts" (Plato, Aristotle, Kant,
  Heidegger and so on). We read there the philosophical text mostly on
  Russian, but we have an origin also before our eyes all over a
  time. You can read more about a seminar on a site <a href="http://bibler.ru">http://bibler.ru</a>
