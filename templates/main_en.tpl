<h4> main principles </h4>

<p>diglossia is intended to facilitate reading and understanding of
classical authors. That is, it is intended for readers and interpreters,
not for researchers. That is, for philologists and philosophers, and a
wide range of readers, but not for linguists, researchers and
scholars. That is to learn from these authors, and not to study and
measure and calculate these texts. But I'll try to help you to have
all the opportunities that have the academic corpuses of classical
texts.</p>

<p>on the left - the source text and on of the right its translations. All
texts and translations for alignment broken by hand into paragraphs
with corresponding meaning. That is, I allowed myself to intervene in
the initial separation of the text into paragraphs (with the kind
permission of translators, who were able to contact). </p>

<p>translations are very easy to switch and compare using Shift-mouse
wheel. Click on the word on the left page provides morphological
analysis and translation of the word. Where there is a sound, you can
listen the text, pointing the position with mouse-click. </p>

<p>texts and translations are taken from the free (and usually
different) sources on the net, and taken as is - with little or no
treatment (except those that were obtained directly from the
translators). That is, there is no guarantee that this very
translation was done with the text. In practice, there is a guarantee
to the contrary. Keep this in mind, finding the divergence of the text
and translation. For serious philological analysis of these texts is
absolutely no good. For a thoughtful philosophical reading, I hope -
well. </p>

<p>so please enjoy and if you are satisfied, spread the word about
this resource.</p>
